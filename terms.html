        By placing an order with us, you agree to receive custom video or photo services, which may include editing, updates, and the creation of personalized gifts or keepsakes.</li>
        <li><strong>Portfolio Use</strong><br>
        During 2026, as part of our portfolio-building initiative, your ordered videos or photos may be featured in our public or private portfolio. By using our services at the discounted rate, you grant us permission to display your project for promotional purposes, unless you request otherwise in writing before your project begins.</li>
        <li><strong>Payment and Pricing</strong><br>
        Services are offered at a significantly reduced cost during the portfolio-building period. All prices will be clearly communicated before your project starts.</li>
        <li><strong>Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong><br>
        We use AI tools alongside our own creative skills and human interaction to enhance the quality of your project. All AI-generated content will be reviewed and refined by our team before delivery.</li>
        <li><strong>Privacy and Confidentiality</strong><br>
        We are committed to protecting your privacy. Any personal information or files you provide will only be used to fulfill your order and will not be shared with third parties, except as required for portfolio purposes (with your permission as stated above).</li>
        <li><strong>Customer Responsibilities</strong><br>
        You are responsible for providing accurate information and materials required for your project. You must ensure you have the rights to any media you submit for editing or inclusion.</li>
        <li><strong>Revisions and Modifications</strong><br>
        Each customer is entitled to request one update or modification to their project without any extra payment. Any additional requests for changes will be billed accordingly and considered on a case-by-case basis. We reserve the right to reject any request that is deemed inappropriate or cannot be reasonably fulfilled.</li>
        <li><strong>Delivery and Refund Policy</strong><br>
        Once you have accepted the final project, it will be delivered to you. After delivery and acceptance, no requests for refunds or money back will be allowed.</li>
        <li><strong>Copyright</strong><br>
        Final edited videos or photos may be used in our portfolio, but you retain personal usage rights. Commercial use by you or third parties may require additional agreement.</li>
